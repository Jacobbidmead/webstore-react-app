E-commerce store clone.

This is a front end e-commerce store, it has very limited functionality in which users are able to add & remove items to a basket and search for items by brand & category. The basket total is also displayed.

As this is purely a front end app, it does not use a database, instead all of the data is held in JSON files. Products can be added to the app by adding an object to the JSON array.

This app uses the material UI component library, to run download the repo and run npm install, then npm run dev.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
